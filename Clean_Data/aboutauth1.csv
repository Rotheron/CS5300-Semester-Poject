30699395249,"A native of Oregon, Diana Marcellas lives in a small resort town, Pinetop-Lakeside, in northeastern Arizona. She recently left her dayjob as director of Legal Aid for the White Mountain Apache to reenter private law practice, and continues to teach history and legal advocacy part-time at the local community college. A fan of SF and fantasy since sixth grade, she began writing SF and fantasy during law school over twenty years ago, published several science-fiction novels in the early 90s, and is currently writing fantasy forTtor. Her first book in the witch of two suns series, Mother Ocean, Daughter Sea, appeared in September 2001, and the second book, The Sea Lark's Song, was published in December 2002, with the third book, Twilight Rising, due out in August 2004. She is currently working on the next book in her series as well as other writing projects. My life is an interesting combination, she says, of the very prosaic and people-oriented practice of law and the more solitary daydreaming of writing fantasy. My Apache friends are often after me to write Apache Tony Hillerman mysteries, but my first love is fantasy and SF, which I began reading as a girl and have never stopped. I first thought up my shari'a witch, Brierley Mefell, while in college, and she has lived in my imagination for over thirty years, much beloved, always fascinating. Other characters have appeared over the years to join the collection of people in my head, but Bri has been with me since the beginning and hers is a story I always wanted to write. Now, thanks to Tor, I have the wonderful privilege of living in Brierley's world, as least vicariously, as I write her ongoing story. Diana's interests include medieval history, practicing Wicca as a solitary witch, Apache tradition and culture, Zebra finches (she has a flock of fourteen), and needlework.                         "

987184359,"About the Author: E.A. Wallis Budge was born in Bodmin, Cornwall to Mary Ann Budge, a young woman whose father was a waiter in a Bodmin hotel. Budge's father has never been identified. Budge left Cornwall as a young man, and eventually came to live with his grandmother and aunt in London.Budge became interested in languages before he was ten years old, but given that he left school at the age of twelve in 1869 to work as a clerk at the firm of W.H. Smith, he studied Hebrew and Syriac in his spare time with the aid of a volunteer tutor named Charles Seeger. Budge became interested in learning the ancient Assyrian language in 1872, when he also began to spend time in the British Museum. Budge's tutor introduced him to the Keeper of Oriental Antiquities, the pioneer Egyptologist Samuel Birch, and Birch's assistant, the Assyriologist George Smith. Smith helped Budge occasionally with his Assyrian, whereas Birch allowed the young man to study cuneiformtablets in his office and obtained books of Middle Eastern travel and adventure such as Sir Austen Henry Layard's Nineveh and Its Remains for him to read from the British Library.From 1869 to 1878 Budge spent whatever free time he had from his job at W.H. Smith studying Assyrian, and he often walked down to St. Paul's Cathedral over his lunch break to study during these years. When the organist of St. Paul's, John Stainer, noticed Budge's hard work, he decided to help the boy to realize his dream of working in a profession that would allow him to study Assyrian. Stainer contacted Budge's employer, the Conservative Member of Parliament W.H. Smith, as well as the former Liberal Prime Minister W.E. Gladstone, and asked them to help his young friend. Both Smith and Gladstone agreed to help Stainer to raise money for Budge to attend Cambridge University, where Budge later studied Semitic languages, including Hebrew, Syriac, Ethiopic and Arabic from 1878 to 1883, continuing to study Assyrian on his own. Budge worked closely during these years with the famous scholar of Semitic languages William Wright, among others. (Quote from en.wikipedia.org)                        "

30285714688,"Ambrose Bierce (1842 -1914) was an American editorialist, journalist, short story writer, fabulist and satirist. Today, he is best known for his short story, An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge and his satirical dictionary, The Devil's Dictionary. The sardonic view of human nature that informed his work - along with his vehemence as a critic - earned him the nickname Bitter Bierce. Despite his reputation as a searing critic, however, Bierce was known to encourage younger writers, including poet George Sterling and fiction writer W. C. Morrow. Bierce employed a distinctive style of writing, especially in his stories. This style often includes a cold open, dark imagery, vague references to time, limited descriptions, the theme of war, and impossible events. In 1913, Bierce traveled to Mexico to gain a firsthand perspective on that country's ongoing revolution. While traveling with rebel troops, the elderly writer disappeared without a trace.                        "

Among his works are two collections of stories, Tales of Soldiers and Civilians and Can Such Things Be?, and a brilliant satire, The Devil�s Dictionary.Algernon Blackwood (1869�1951) was born into an upper-class British family. He emigrated to America at the age of twenty and stayed there some ten years, during which time he worked as a reporter for The New York Evening Sun and The New York Times. When he returned to England he turned to writing fiction and soon made a name for himself with the John Silence stories, which relate the exploits of a psychic detective. Blackwood became famous in later years for playing �the Ghost Man� on BBC radio.R.W. Chambers (1865�1933) was born in Brooklyn and studied at the Art Students League and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, exhibiting in the Salon in 1889. He sold illustrations to fashion magazines in New York City before taking up writing and finding success with his collection of stories The King in Yellow, which includes �The Repairer of Reputations.� In later life Chambers published a number of highly successful popular novels, including The Restless Sex and Police!!!, the proceeds from which allowed him to settle in a mansion in upstate New York, where he devoted himself to hunting and fishing.Walter de la Mare (1876�1956) was one of seven children of an official at the Bank of England. He did not attend university, but worked as a bookkeeper for an oil company for some eighteen years, in the course of which he published the poems and stories that secured his literary reputation. In 1908 a grant from the Civil List allowed him to write full time. De la Mare�s fiction includes the novels The Return and The Memoirs of a Midget, as well as many stories. His poems for children and adults and his brilliantly inventive anthologies were much admired by T.S. Eliot, who became his publisher, and by W.H. Auden.Henry James (1843�1916) was born in New York City. His father was a distinguished theologian and a follower of Emanuel Swedenborg; his older brother William James became one of America�s finest philosophers. James attended Harvard Law School and, with the encouragement of William Dean Howells, took to writing criticism and fiction. After 1866 he lived largely in Europe. His many works include the novels A Portrait of a Lady, The Wings of the Dove, The Ambassadors, and The Golden Bowl, as well as many short stories.H.P. Lovecraft (1890�1937) was born and died in Providence, Rhode Island. His father died of syphilis when he was eight years old; his mother was later institutionalized for mental illness; and Lovecraft himself was a sickly child.� In 1913 he joined the United Amateur Press Association, beginning a career as a writer in the course of which he published poems, journalism, and stories. Increasingly drawn to horror fiction, Lovecraft was a regular contributor to the Chicago pulp magazine Weird Tales. His first book-length collection of stories, The Outsider, did not appear until 1939, two years after his death.Arthur Machen (1863�1947) was born in Wales. After failing to gain admission to the Royal College of Surgeons, he worked, not very successfully, as a journalist and translator (most famously of Casanova�s memoirs). A friend of the mystic A.E. Waite and a member of the Order of Golden Dawn,� Machen was deeply interested in the occult. His fiction includes The Great God Pan, The Three Impostors, and The Hill of Dreams. Edgar Allan Poe (1809�1849) was the son of two traveling actors. Born in Boston, he was orphaned early and adopted by a tobacco exporter in Richmond, Virginia. Poe attended the University of Virginia, which he left because of gambling debts, and West Point, from which he was dishonorably discharged. �MS. Found in a Bottle� was Poe�s first significant success, and it helped him to obtain an editorial position on The Southern Literary Messenger in Baltimore, though he was soon fired for drinking. Poe married his thirteen-year-old cousin, Virginia, and moved north, where he lived in New York City and Philadelphia while continuing to produce poems, criticism, and stories at a prodigious rate. After his wife�s death from tuberculosis, Poe�s behavior became increasingly erratic. In 1849 he was found drunk and delirious in a bar in Baltimore, the apparent victim of a political gang that had kept him inebriated while escorting him from ballot station to ballot station to cast repeat votes. He died four days later. M.P. Shiel (1865�1947) was born in the West Indies, the son of a Methodist minister of Irish and African descent. Shiel studied classics at King�s College London, flirted with medicine, then took up journalism. His most popular work in his lifetime was his novel The Yellow Danger, and Shiel, who became increasingly xenophobic over the course of his life, is said to have invented the term �the yellow peril.� His best-known work today is the remarkable apocalyptic fantasy The Purple Cloud. Described by contemporaries as �gorgeously mad,� Shiel had become a reclusive religious maniac by the time of his death. His last book, Jesus, remains unpublished.Bram Stoker (1847�1912) was born in Dublin and studied mathematics at Trinity College, by which time he was already composing horror stories.

Among his works are two collections of stories, Tales of Soldiers and Civilians and Can Such Things Be?, and a brilliant satire, The Devil�s Dictionary.Algernon Blackwood (1869�1951) was born into an upper-class British family. He emigrated to America at the age of twenty and stayed there some ten years, during which time he worked as a reporter for The New York Evening Sun and The New York Times. When he returned to England he turned to writing fiction and soon made a name for himself with the John Silence stories, which relate the exploits of a psychic detective. Blackwood became famous in later years for playing �the Ghost Man� on BBC radio.R.W. Chambers (1865�1933) was born in Brooklyn and studied at the Art Students League and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, exhibiting in the Salon in 1889. He sold illustrations to fashion magazines in New York City before taking up writing and finding success with his collection of stories The King in Yellow, which includes �The Repairer of Reputations.� In later life Chambers published a number of highly successful popular novels, including The Restless Sex and Police!!!, the proceeds from which allowed him to settle in a mansion in upstate New York, where he devoted himself to hunting and fishing.Walter de la Mare (1876�1956) was one of seven children of an official at the Bank of England. He did not attend university, but worked as a bookkeeper for an oil company for some eighteen years, in the course of which he published the poems and stories that secured his literary reputation. In 1908 a grant from the Civil List allowed him to write full time. De la Mare�s fiction includes the novels The Return and The Memoirs of a Midget, as well as many stories. His poems for children and adults and his brilliantly inventive anthologies were much admired by T.S. Eliot, who became his publisher, and by W.H. Auden.Henry James (1843�1916) was born in New York City. His father was a distinguished theologian and a follower of Emanuel Swedenborg; his older brother William James became one of America�s finest philosophers. James attended Harvard Law School and, with the encouragement of William Dean Howells, took to writing criticism and fiction. After 1866 he lived largely in Europe. His many works include the novels A Portrait of a Lady, The Wings of the Dove, The Ambassadors, and The Golden Bowl, as well as many short stories.H.P. Lovecraft (1890�1937) was born and died in Providence, Rhode Island. His father died of syphilis when he was eight years old; his mother was later institutionalized for mental illness; and Lovecraft himself was a sickly child.� In 1913 he joined the United Amateur Press Association, beginning a career as a writer in the course of which he published poems, journalism, and stories. Increasingly drawn to horror fiction, Lovecraft was a regular contributor to the Chicago pulp magazine Weird Tales. His first book-length collection of stories, The Outsider, did not appear until 1939, two years after his death.Arthur Machen (1863�1947) was born in Wales. After failing to gain admission to the Royal College of Surgeons, he worked, not very successfully, as a journalist and translator (most famously of Casanova�s memoirs). A friend of the mystic A.E. Waite and a member of the Order of Golden Dawn,� Machen was deeply interested in the occult. His fiction includes The Great God Pan, The Three Impostors, and The Hill of Dreams. Edgar Allan Poe (1809�1849) was the son of two traveling actors. Born in Boston, he was orphaned early and adopted by a tobacco exporter in Richmond, Virginia. Poe attended the University of Virginia, which he left because of gambling debts, and West Point, from which he was dishonorably discharged. �MS. Found in a Bottle� was Poe�s first significant success, and it helped him to obtain an editorial position on The Southern Literary Messenger in Baltimore, though he was soon fired for drinking. Poe married his thirteen-year-old cousin, Virginia, and moved north, where he lived in New York City and Philadelphia while continuing to produce poems, criticism, and stories at a prodigious rate. After his wife�s death from tuberculosis, Poe�s behavior became increasingly erratic. In 1849 he was found drunk and delirious in a bar in Baltimore, the apparent victim of a political gang that had kept him inebriated while escorting him from ballot station to ballot station to cast repeat votes. He died four days later. M.P. Shiel (1865�1947) was born in the West Indies, the son of a Methodist minister of Irish and African descent. Shiel studied classics at King�s College London, flirted with medicine, then took up journalism. His most popular work in his lifetime was his novel The Yellow Danger, and Shiel, who became increasingly xenophobic over the course of his life, is said to have invented the term �the yellow peril.� His best-known work today is the remarkable apocalyptic fantasy The Purple Cloud. Described by contemporaries as �gorgeously mad,� Shiel had become a reclusive religious maniac by the time of his death. His last book, Jesus, remains unpublished.Bram Stoker (1847�1912) was born in Dublin and studied mathematics at Trinity College, by which time he was already composing horror stories.

He worked as an attorney�s clerk and newspaper reporter until his Sketches by Boz (1836) and The Pickwick Papers (1837) brought him the amazing and instant success that was to be his for the remainder of his life. In later years, the pressure of serial writing, editorial duties, lectures, and social commitments led to his separation from Catherine Hogarth after twenty-three years of marriage. It also hastened his death at the age of fifty-eight, when he was characteristically engaged in a multitude of work.                        "

Critics George Gissing and G. K. Chesterton championed Dickens' mastery of prose, his endless invention of unique, clever personalities, and his powerful social sensibilities, but fellow writers such as George Henry Lewes, Henry James, and Virginia Woolf faulted his work for sentimentality, implausible occurrences, and grotesque characterizations.The popularity of Dickens' novels and short stories has meant that they have never gone out of print.

He is mostly known for his joint work with Franco Lucentini, especially as authors of crime novels. The duo was also editor of the science fiction series Urania from the 1960s to the 1980s. �Franco Lucentini (December 24, 1920 - August 5, 2002) was an Italian writer, journalist, translator and editor of anthologies.  Born in Rome on 24 December 1920 to Emma Marzi and Venanzio Lucentini, a miller from Marche and later the owner of a bakery in Rome. While studying Philosophy at the University of Rome, Lucentini was one of the organizers of a practical joke against the fascist regime: on 5 May 1941 he and a friend distributed among other students paper streamers. When unrolled during a public meeting, they revealed writings such as Down with the war!, Down with Hitler! and Long live freedom!. Lucentini was arrested and spent two months in prison. Lucentini graduated in February 1943. Called to arms in 1943, he was refused the admission to the training to become an officer. After the Armistice, the Allied armed forces put to use his writing skills as a junior editor for the United Nations News press agency in Naples. After the war, Lucentini worked in Rome for ANSA news agency; later, associated with ONA news agency, he went to Prague and Vienna. The atmosphere of postwar Vienna gave him the inspiration for the novella I compagni sconosciuti. After a brief time again in Rome, in 1949 he left for Paris where he was employed in several jobs (deliveryman, teacher, masseur). While in Paris, he first met the two most important people in his life: Simone Benne Darses, 12 years older than him, who was to become his lifetime wife; and, in 1952, Carlo Fruttero, with whom a life-long literary collaboration began in 1957, when Lucentini moved to Turin, where both of them worked for Einaudi publishing house. Lucentini frequently traveled to Paris in scouting assignments for Einaudi looking for new authors and titles to bring to Italy. He discovered, amongst other's, Jorge Luis Borges and was responsible for the translation from the original Spanish versions to Italian. Lucentini also translated several foreign books for Einaudi from many different languages including Chinesse and Japanese. As a very successful and appreciated team, Fruttero & Lucentini wrote books and worked in publishing, directing book series and magazines (Il Mago, Urania), and editing fiction anthologies, for Einaudi publishing house and, since 1961, for Mondadori. In 1972 Lucentini and Fruttero began writing for Turin-based newspaper La Stampa (then directed by Alberto Ronchey), writing the column L'Agenda di F. & L., commenting with humour and irony on current facts; they also wrote for L'Espresso and Epoca. Their first book was the poetry collection L'idraulico non verr�, in 1971. But the first largely successful work was the crime novel La donna della domenica (1972), set in Turin.

30256432945,"Did you know that the author of A Christmas Carol, Charles Dickens�, childhood was very similar to the lives of the characters he wrote about? He spent his first years in several different English coastal towns. At age nine, the Dickens family moved to London and life seemed positive and promising for little Charles. Things changed drastically when his father was sent to prison because he could not pay his debts. This is when Charles first started to learn about poverty and child labor, two things that would play a big role in his future stories. After his father was arrested, Charles quit school and started to work in a factory to earn money for his family. He was only twelve years old and was forced to work for ten hours every day with a lot of other children under harsh conditions. The time in the factory lasted only three months, but it would stay with Charles for the rest of his life. He used his own experiences and memories in many of his books. And as a writer, he would also fight for the rights of children and the improvement of their plight . In the end, Charles was able to finish school and got a job at a law office, and later in a court. He published his first book when he was 25 and from then on he was transformed into one of England�s most popular writers. Charles Dickens lived in a period known as the Victorian era. This was a time where a lot of advancements were made in England. The country became richer and more modern, and the population grew rapidly . At the same time childhood poverty increased and many children were forced to work in unhealthy and dangerous jobs. The good and bad sides of the Victorian era were especially clear in a huge city like London, where he lived for quite a few years. In his books, Dickens writes about what he thought was wrong in Victorian England. He wanted to make people see that some things, like poverty and child labor, really had to be dealt with. This made him not only a storyteller, but also a social critic. Charles Dickens believed that stories and literature were powerful enough to change society. And indeed, his writings opened eyes and got them talking about the misery many citizens were in. Charles Dickens died when he was 58, in 1870. His health had gotten worse in previous years. He is buried in London. To this day, Dickens is still one of the most beloved of English writers. Many assert A Christmas Carol remains his signature creation.                        "

Burroughs was born on September 1, 1875, in Chicago, Illinois (he later lived for many years in the suburb of Oak Park), the fourth son of Major George Tyler Burroughs (1833�1913), a businessman and Civil War veteran, and his wife, Mary Evaline (Zieger) Burroughs (1840�1920). His middle name is from his paternal grandmother, Mary Rice Burroughs (1802�c.1870). After his discharge from the Army, Burroughs worked a number of different jobs. He drifted and worked on a ranch in Idaho. He found work at his father's firm in 1899. He married his childhood sweetheart, Emma Hulbert (1876�1944), in January 1900. In 1904, he left his job and worked less regularly, first in Idaho, then in Chicago. Burroughs took up writing full-time in 1912, and by the time the run of Under the Moons of Mars had finished, he had completed two novels, including Tarzan of the Apes, published from October 1912 and one of his most successful series. Burroughs also wrote popular science fiction and fantasy stories involving adventurers from Earth transported to various planets (notably Barsoom, Burroughs's fictional name for Mars, and Amtor, his fictional name for Venus), lost islands, and into the interior of the hollow earth in his Pellucidar stories. He also wrote Westerns and historical romances. Besides those published in All-Story, many of his stories were published in The Argosy magazine. After WW II ended, Burroughs moved back to Encino, California, where after many health problems, he died of a heart attack on March 19, 1950, having written almost 80 novels. He is buried at Tarzana, California, US.                        "

30692706136,"Jane Austen (1775-1817) was extremely modest about her own genius but has become one of English literature's most famous women writers. She is also the author of Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Persuasion, and Northanger Abbey.                        "
30718682962,"Jane Austen (December 1775 � 18 July 1817) was an English novelist known primarily for her six major novels which interpret, critique and comment upon the life of the British landed gentry at the end of the 18th century. Her most highly praised novel during her lifetime was Pride and Prejudice, her second published novel. Austen's plots often explore the dependence of women on marriage in the pursuit of favorable social standing and economic security. The author's major novels are rarely out of print today, although they were first published anonymously and brought her little fame and brief reviews during her lifetime. A significant transition in her posthumous reputation as an author occurred in 1869, fifty-two years after her death, when her nephew's publication of A Memoir of Jane Austen introduced her to a wider audience. Austen's most successful novel during her lifetime was Pride and Prejudice, which went through two editions at the time. Her third published novel was Mansfield Park, which (despite being largely overlooked by reviewers) was successful during her lifetime.                        "

30699880571,"M�ric J�kay de �sva (1825 - 1904), outside Hungary also known as Maurus Jokai, was a Hungarian dramatist and novelist. J�kai was extremely prolific. It was to literature that he continued to devote most of his time and his productiveness after 1870 was stupendous, amounting to some hundreds of volumes. Stranger still, none of this work is slipshod and the best of it deserves to endure. Amongst the finest of his later works may be mentioned the unique and incomparable Az arany ember (A Man of Gold, translated into English, among others, under the title The Man with the Golden Touch), the most popular A kosz�vu ember fiai (The Heartless Man's Sons), the heroic chronicle of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and A tengerszemu h�lgy (Eyes like the Sea), the latter of which won the Academy's prize in 1890. He was also an amateur chess player. His j�vo sz�zad reg�nye (The novel of the next century - 1872) is accounted an important early work of Science Fiction though the term did not yet exist at the time. In spite of its romantic trappings, this monumental two-volume novel includes some acute observations and almost prophetic visions, such as the prediction of a revolution in Russia and the establishment of a totalitarian state there, or the arrival of aviation. Because it could be read as a satirical allegory on Leninism and Stalinism in the Soviet Union, the book was banned in Hungary in the decades of the Communist r�gime. (Its Critical Edition was delayed until 1981.)                        "

30712476245,"One of the grand masters of Victorian literature, Charles Dickens was born on February 7, 1812, in Landport, Portsea, England. He died in Kent on June 9, 1870. The second of eight children of a family continually plagued by debt, the young Dickens came to know not only hunger and privation, but also the horror of the infamous debtors' prison and the evils of child labor. A turn of fortune in the shape of a legacy brought release from the nightmare of prison and slave factories and afforded Dickens the opportunity of two years' formal schooling at Wellington House Academy. He worked as an attorney's clerk and newspaper reporter until his Sketches by Boz (1836) and The Pickwick Papers (1837) brought him the amazing and instant success that was to be his for the remainder of his life. In later years, the pressure of serial writing, editorial duties, lectures, and social commitments led to his separation from Catherine Hogarth after 23 years of marriage. It also hastened his death at the age of 58, when he was characteristically engaged in a multitude of work.                        "

The public was not happy about the detective�s demise and Conan Doyle was forced to resurrect Holmes. Conan Doyle also wrote non-fiction, and he was knighted for publishing a pamphlet justifying Britain's involvement in the Boer War. He also wrote histories of the Boer War and World War One.

30737329914,"The creator of Sherlock Holmes, the world's most famous literary detective. Born in Scotland, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was a practising doctor when he began to write tales of mystery and adventure. In addition to the Sherlock Holmes stories, Conan Doyle also wrote the Professor Challenger adventures, and his classic, The Lost World, is one of the original fantasy novels. Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930) was born in Edinburgh and studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh's Medical School. Graduating in 1881, he set up practice as an occultist, but as patients proved elusive he turned to writing. An important influence upon his literary career was his professor, Dr Joseph Bell, who could observe the most minute detail regarding a patient's condition. This master of deduction became the model for Conan Doyle's legendary literary creation, the detective Sherlock Holmes, introduced in �A Study in Scarlet� in 1887. Conan Doyle also espoused spiritualism and devoted considerable time and effort to a campaign of support for this cause. He also wrote successfully in genres other than detective fiction. His non-fiction includes military writing on the Boer War and pamphlets on spiritualism. It is known that he felt constricted at times by the popularity of Holmes, but it is nevertheless for Sherlock Holmes and his foil, the ponderous Dr Watson that he is best remembered. As Sherlock Holmes was the first detective to solve cases by deduction rather than due to an error by the criminal, Conan Doyle can be credited with creating the modern detective novel. He was knighted in 1902 for his support of the British cause in the Boer Wars. After the death of his son in the First World War, he devoted the rest of his life to spiritualism on which he wrote and lectured.                        "

30693367406,"William Faulkner, one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century, was born in New Albany, Mississippi, on September 25, 1897. He published his first book, The Marble Faun, in 1924, but it is as a literary chronicler of life in the Deep South--particularly in the fictional Yoknapatawpha County, the setting for several of his novels--that he is most highly regarded. In such novels as The Sound and the Fury, As I Lay Dying, Light in August, and Absalom, Absalom! he explored the full range of post-Civil War Southern life, focusing both on the personal histories of his characters and on the moral uncertainties of an increasingly dissolute society. In combining the use of symbolism with a stream-of-consciousness technique, he created a new approach to fiction writing. In 1949 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. William Faulkner died in Byhalia, Mississippi, on July 6, 1962.                        "

30243595638,"William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon in April 1564, and his birth is traditionally celebrated on April 23. The facts of his life, known from surviving documents, are sparse. He was one of eight children born to John Shakespeare, a merchant of some standing in his community. William probably went to the King�s New School in Stratford, but he had no university education. In November 1582, at the age of eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway, eight years his senior, who was pregnant with their first child, Susanna. She was born on May 26, 1583. Twins, a boy, Hamnet ( who would die at age eleven), and a girl, Judith, were born in 1585. By 1592 Shakespeare had gone to London working as an actor and already known as a playwright. A rival dramatist, Robert Greene, referred to him as �an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers.� Shakespeare became a principal shareholder and playwright of the successful acting troupe, the Lord Chamberlain�s Men (later under James I, called the King�s Men). In 1599 the Lord Chamberlain�s Men built and occupied the Globe Theater in Southwark near the Thames River. Here many of Shakespeare�s plays were performed by the most famous actors of his time, including Richard Burbage, Will Kempe, and Robert Armin. In addition to his 37 plays, Shakespeare had a hand in others, including Sir Thomas More and The Two Noble Kinsmen, and he wrote poems, including Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece. His 154 sonnets were published, probably without his authorization, in 1609. In 1611 or 1612 he gave up his lodgings in London and devoted more and more time to retirement in Stratford, though he continued writing such plays as The Tempest and Henry VII until about 1613. He died on April 23 1616, and was buried in Holy Trinity Church, Stratford. No collected edition of his plays was published during his life-time, but in 1623 two members of his acting company, John Heminges and Henry Condell, put together the great collection now called the First Folio.
